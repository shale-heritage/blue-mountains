### **1\. Project Title, Description, and Objectives**

**Project Title:** History, heritage and environmental change in a deindustrialised landscape

**Funding scheme**: ARC Linkage Project (LP190100900)  
**Start date**: 01 July 2020  
**End date**: 31 December 2024

**Description:** This project aims to conduct the first collaborative and multidisciplinary study of a forgotten shale-mining settlement in the environmentally and culturally significant Jamison Valley. The study will combine archaeological, archival, and oral evidence to provide new insights into everyday working and family life, community, gender, transiency, and migration. The goal is to contribute to conservation efforts, heritage tourism, and education amidst environmental changes.

**Objectives:**

1. Reconstruct, analyse, and interpret working, family, and community life in the Ruined Castle shale mining village (1880-1914).  
2. Collect, record, and analyse new material evidence through archaeological surveys and excavations.  
3. Deploy and assess digital methods to support data dissemination.  
4. Produce traditional and multimedia historical accounts for a wide audience.  
5. Engage lifelong learners and promote intergenerational learning.
