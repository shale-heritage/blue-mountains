## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review HIGH PRIORITY items** (Multiple PDFs section)
   - Open each item in Zotero web interface: `https://www.zotero.org/groups/2258643/items/ITEM_KEY`
   - Check if PDFs are: (a) same article split across pages, or (b) distinct sources
   - If distinct sources, plan to split into separate entries

2. **Spot-check other categories** to validate categorisation

3. **Document splitting workflow** if items need to be separated
