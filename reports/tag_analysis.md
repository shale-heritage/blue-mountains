## 4. Recommendations for Tag Rationalization

Based on this analysis, here are recommended next steps:

### A. Similar Tags to Consolidate

1. **Review high-similarity pairs** (>90% similarity) - likely duplicates or spelling variations
2. **Standardize singular/plural forms** - choose a convention (e.g., always plural)
3. **Resolve case inconsistencies** - establish capitalization rules

### B. Develop Hierarchical Taxonomy

Consider organizing tags into categories based on:

1. **Geographic hierarchy:** Region → Town → Specific location
2. **Thematic categories:** Industries, Social institutions, Events
3. **Temporal categories:** Time periods, specific dates
4. **Actor types:** People, Organizations, Government entities

### C. Tag Categories (Suggested from Top Tags)

Based on frequency and co-occurrence:

**Geographic:**
- Katoomba, Megalong, Lithgow, Hartley Vale, etc.

**Industry:**
- Shale mines, Mining, Miners, Coal, Railway

**Social:**
- Court, Court cases, Death, Church, Salvation Army
- Recreation for miners, Sports

**Infrastructure:**
- Hotels, Accommodation, Railway

**Organizations:**
- A.K.O. & M. Company

### D. Next Steps

1. **Collaborative review** with project historians
2. **Create controlled vocabulary** with definitions
3. **Map tags to standard vocabularies** (Getty, etc.)
4. **Develop tagging guidelines** for consistency
