	abstract = {This short report presents the findings of the five-day pedestrian survey of potential settlement areas near the Ruined Castle shale mines, which operated in the late-19th and early-20th centuries in the Jamison Valley near Katoomba, NSW. Sponsored by the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute, the survey revealed over 250 surface features, including the foundations of dwellings, artefact scatters and isolated finds, indicating the archaeological potential of the area. Preliminary investigation of documentary resources offers great potential for integrated historical-archaeological research into the lives of miners in isolated pre-World War I settlements in the Blue Mountains.},
