# Blue Mountains Digital Collection Project: Folksonomy Logic and Tagging Guidelines

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** Phase 1.1 Documentation - Current Tagging System
**Project:** LP190100900 - History, Heritage and Environmental Change in a Deindustrialised Landscape

---

## Executive Summary

This document records the tagging logic and categorisation approach developed inductively by historians, archaeologists, and research assistants working on the Blue Mountains shale mining communities project (c. 1880-1914). The project studies working, family and community life in isolated mining settlements at Ruined Castle and Nellie's Glen in the Jamison and Megalong Valleys near Katoomba, NSW.

**Current Status (October 2025):**

- **Total items in Zotero:** 1,189
  - **Primary sources (tagged):** 304 items (25.6% of total, 90.5% of tagged items)
  - **Other tagged items:** 32 items (2.7% of total, 9.5% of tagged items)
  - **Untagged items:** 853 items (71.7% of total - likely secondary sources, references, or awaiting processing)
- **Unique tags:** 481
- **Total tag applications:** 3,775
- **Average tags per tagged item:** 11.24
- **Archaeological features documented:** ~256 (Parkes et al. 2018 pilot survey at Ruined Castle)
- **Artefacts/artefact groups documented:** ~256 (from FAIMS Mobile survey data)

**Three Parallel Tagging Systems:**

1. **Historical documents (Zotero):** Social history themes, people, places, events, institutions
   - Primary sources: 304 items (90.5% of tagged items)
   - Developed by historians and research assistants
2. **Archaeological features (FAIMS Mobile):** Built environment, structures, work sites + social theme associations
   - ~256 features documented at Ruined Castle and Nellie's Glen
   - Developed by archaeological team led by Shawn Ross
3. **Artefacts (FAIMS Mobile):** Functional categories (EAMC schema) + social theme associations
   - ~256 artefacts/groups documented
   - Functional categories to be verified with artefact specialist Penny Crook

## 1. Project Research Themes and Tagging Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Research Questions

The tagging system was designed to support investigation of:

1. **Social history themes:** Working-class everyday life, family structures, community formation, gender roles, class relations, material culture, standards of living
2. **Economic and labour history:** Mining work, wages, employment patterns, itinerancy, economic boom/bust cycles, company operations
3. **Family history:** Named individuals, family groups, kinship networks, intergenerational relationships
4. **Deindustrialisation and memory:** Landscape change, ruination, environmental recovery, memorialisation
5. **Environmental change:** Bushfire impacts, landscape transformation, heritage conservation

### 1.2 Tagging Philosophy

**Inductive approach:** Tags emerged organically from source material rather than being imposed through pre-existing controlled vocabularies. This reflects the expertise and research priorities of public historians, family historians, social historians, and archaeologists working collaboratively.

**Evidence-driven:** Tags capture what can be learned from primary sources (newspaper articles, court records, photographs, archaeological heritage) rather than imposing external interpretive frameworks.

**Multiple perspectives:** The system accommodates three specialist approaches (historical, archaeological, artefact analysis) whilst maintaining connection through shared social history themes.

**User community:** Designed to serve academic researchers, heritage managers, local historians, family historians, and public audiences engaging with Blue Mountains mining heritage.

## 2. Historical Document Tagging System

### 2.1 Social History Theme Tags

These tags enable grouping, analysis, and public presentation of documents related to particular historical themes. They represent the **primary organising principle** for the collection.

**Social themes:**

- Women, children, families
- Marriage, death, birth
- Education, literacy
- Religion, church, spirituality

**Economic and labour themes:**

- Labour, work, employment, unemployment
- Wages, payment, economy
- Mining, miners, shale mines
- Companies (e.g., "A.K.O. & M. Company", "Katoomba Coal and Shale Company")
- Industry, commerce
- Itinerancy, migration, transiency

**Living conditions themes:**

- Housing, accommodation, dwellings
- Food, drink, alcohol, alcoholism
- Sanitary conditions, disease, health
- Poverty, wealth, class

**Social order themes:**

- Crime, violence, theft
- Court, court cases, legal proceedings
- Police, law enforcement
- Government, regulation, licensing

**Community and leisure themes:**

- Recreation, sports, entertainment
- Concerts, performances
- Church, religious organisations (e.g., "Salvation Army", "Methodist Church")
- Associations, clubs, societies

**Events as evidence:** Events (deaths, accidents, court cases, concerts, meetings) are tagged when they provide evidence for social history themes. Example: A mining accident report is tagged with "mining accidents", "death", "miners", "working conditions", relevant company names, and location.

### 2.2 Geographic Tags

**Purpose:** Record where events occurred, enable spatial analysis, support heritage mapping, link to gazetteers (particularly Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names - TGN).

**Spatial Hierarchy:**

```text
Greater Katoomba Region
├── Katoomba (town/settlement)
│   ├── [Specific institutions/places within Katoomba]
│   └── South Katoomba (district within town)
├── Ruined Castle (mining district/valley - Jamison Valley)
│   ├── Ruined Castle Shale Mine
│   ├── Ruined Castle track
│   └── [Other features within district]
├── Nellie's Glen (mining district/valley - Megalong Valley)
│   ├── Nellie's Glen Shale Mine
│   ├── Nellie's Glen Road
│   ├── Nellie's Glen track
│   └── [Other features within district]
├── Megalong (separate settlement - Megalong Valley)
│   ├── Megalong Hotel
│   ├── Megalong Valley School
│   ├── Megalong Shale Mines
│   └── [Other features]
└── Other settlements (Lithgow, Hartley Vale, Wentworth Falls, Leura, Blackheath, Mount Victoria, etc.)
```

**Tagging approach:**

- Apply **hierarchical place tags** where spatial relationships are clear
- Use **multiple co-occurring tags** for specific locations (e.g., item about Katoomba Court gets both "Katoomba" and "Katoomba Court")
- **Mining districts** (Ruined Castle, Nellie's Glen) are distinct from **towns** (Katoomba, Megalong)
- All geographic features should ultimately be associated with **coordinates or polygon boundaries** for mapping

**Geospatial integration:**

- Point features: Specific buildings, mine entrances
- Line features: Roads, tracks, railway lines, ropeways
- Polygon features: Mining districts, settlements, valleys, land parcels

### 2.3 Institution Tags

**Two-level hierarchy:**

#### Level 1: Institution Type (broad category)

- Court
- Hotel / Pub / Accommodation
- School
- Church
- Mine
- Post office
- Railway
- Hospital
- Store / Shop
- Hall (community building)
- Lodge (fraternal organisation)

#### Level 2: Named Institution (specific instance)

- Court → Katoomba Court, Supreme Court, Police court, Licensing Court
- Hotel → Katoomba Hotel, Carrington Hotel, Imperial Hotel, Megalong Hotel
- School → Katoomba Public School, Katoomba Superior Public School, Megalong Valley School
- Church → Katoomba Congregational Church, St Hilda's Church, Wesleyan Church
- Mine → Ruined Castle Shale Mine, Nellie's Glen Shale Mine, Katoomba Coal Mine

**Tagging approach:**

- Apply **both** institution type and specific named institution where applicable
- For geographic specificity, also apply relevant place name tag
- Example: An article about Katoomba Court receives three tags: "Court", "Katoomba Court", "Katoomba"

### 2.4 People and Family Tags

**Purpose:** Support family history research, enable prosopographical analysis, document kinship networks, link to biographical resources (Australian Dictionary of Biography - ADB).

**Individual people:**

- Tag with **full formal names** as consistently as possible
- Use **square brackets [ ]** to expand abbreviated names not fully spelled out in source
  - Example: "Mr W. James" → "Mr W[illiam] James"
  - Example: "Mrs Smith" → "Mrs [Mary] Smith" (once identified)
- Include **honorifics and titles** as they appear in sources (Mr, Mrs, Miss, Dr, Reverend, etc.)
- Tag **all individuals mentioned** in a document, not just protagonists

**Families:**

- Create **family tags** as separate thematic tags (e.g., "Meredith family", "Goyder family", "Austin family")
- Apply family tag in **addition to** individual person tags
- Family tags support family history research and should not be inferred from co-occurrence alone

**Consistency challenges:**

- Many similar-looking names represent **different people** (e.g., "Mr Wilson", "Mrs Wilson", "Mr W Wilson", "Mr Albert C Wilson" are likely 3-4 distinct individuals)
- **Disambiguation needed:** Through Named Entity Recognition (NER) and biographical dictionary research
- **Future work:** Create complete register of people mentioned in corpus, link to ADB entries where available

### 2.5 Temporal Tags

**Purpose:** Enable chronological analysis, track change over time, support event-based research.

**Format:**

- Specific years: "1880", "1889", "1893", "1903"
- Year ranges: "1880-1885", "1889-1897", "1890s"

**Significant periods for this project:**

- **1880-1882:** Discovery of oil shale at Ruined Castle, early prospecting (North period)
- **1885-1889:** Katoomba Coal and Shale Company formation, ropeway installation, peak employment
- **September 1889:** Financial crisis, temporary mine closure
- **1889-1897:** Australian Kerosene Oil and Mineral Company (AKO&M) lease period
- **1893:** Peak employment (60 miners at Ruined Castle)
- **1897:** Mine closure
- **1903:** Brief reopening
- **1905:** Final abandonment

**Event-based periods** (for consideration during rationalisation):

- Pre-1889 financial crisis
- Post-Federation (1901)
- Pre-World War I

### 2.6 Document Type: "Primary Source"

**Current status:** Applied to 304 out of 336 tagged items (90%)

**Analysis:** This is essentially **item metadata** rather than a subject tag. It describes the **nature of the document** (primary vs secondary source) rather than its **content**.

**Recommendation for rationalisation:**

- Move "Primary source" designation to **item type metadata** field in Zotero
- Reserve tags for **subject/thematic content only**
- This will reduce tag clutter and improve subject-based discovery

**Other potential document type categories:**

- Newspaper article
- Court record / transcript
- Government report
- Personal correspondence / letter
- Photograph
- Map / plan
- Oral history interview / transcript

## 3. Archaeological Feature Tagging System

### 3.1 Tagging Philosophy for Material Remains

Archaeological features were tagged by the project archaeological team (led by digital humanist Shawn Ross) to:

1. **Classify structural remains** by function and type
2. **Apply social history theme tags** where material evidence supports interpretation
3. **Integrate archaeological and historical evidence** through shared tagging vocabulary

**Limitations:** Archaeological surface survey reveals structural remains and scattered artefacts, but interpretation is more constrained than with textual sources. Social history theme tags applied only when **material evidence clearly supports** the interpretation.

### 3.2 Built Environment Categories

Based on **Parkes et al. 2018** pilot survey and expanded fieldwork at Ruined Castle and Nellie's Glen.

#### 3.2.1 Structure | Building

**Domestic:**

- **Hut:** Small, simple, single-storey dwelling - single room, hearth, <12 sq m (indicates **transient settlement**)
- **Dwelling:** More substantial house or place of residence - >1 room, hearth, complex shape, >12 sq m (indicates **sustained settlement**)
- **Accommodation:** General housing structures

**Commercial:**

- Hotel
- Shop
- Pub
- Butcher

**Government:**

- Post office
- School (may also be Community)

**Community:**

- Hall
- Church
- School (may also be Government)

**Industrial:**

- Managers' residence (e.g., "Overseer's cottage" - noted in historical records for quality masonry)
- Office

#### 3.2.2 Work Features

**Industrial:**

- Addit (horizontal mine entrance)
- Ropeway elements (Bleichert ropeway infrastructure, documented by Crook et al. 2015)
- Mine shaft
- Spoil heap

**Transport:**

- Bridge
- Road
- Tramway (horse tramway to Ruined Castle mines)
- Railway

**Infrastructure:**

- Sewerage / waste
- Water supply

**Other:**

- Sawn tree (logging activity)
- Fence post
- Boundary marker

#### 3.2.3 Cut Features / Depressions

**Feature types:**

- **Posthole:** Evidence of timber structures
- **Pit:** Refuse pit, latrine, storage pit, or mining test pit
- **Hearth:** Cooking or heating feature
- **Platform:** Levelled foundation for structure

### 3.3 Applying Social History Themes to Archaeological Features

**Evidence-based interpretation only.** Examples from fieldwork:

| Archaeological Evidence | Functional Tag | Social Theme Tag(s) | Rationale |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Gin bottles (glass fragments) | bottles | alcohol | Direct evidence of alcohol consumption |
| Children's toys | toys | children, families | Indicates family occupation |
| Cooking implements | cooking implements | food | Food preparation evidence |
| Refuse pit contents | waste | (variable) | May contain diverse evidence |
| Gender-specific artefacts (e.g., dress fasteners, jewellery) | (specific item type) | women | Indicates female occupation |
| High-quality masonry structure | (building type) | (none / class?) | "Overseer's cottage" suggests hierarchy |
| Small hut (<12 sq m) | hut | itinerancy, transient settlement | Gant-Thompson 2008 typology |
| Larger dwelling (>12 sq m) | dwelling | families, sustained settlement | Gant-Thompson 2008 typology |

**Future work:** After historical document tag rationalisation is complete, **revisit archaeological feature tags** to:

- Align terminology with rationalised historical tags
- Enrich feature tags with additional social theme associations
- Ensure consistency between archaeological and historical tagging vocabularies

---

## 4. Artefact Tagging System

### 4.1 Dual Classification Approach

Artefacts receive **two types of tags:**

1. **Functional category:** What the object was used for (based on EAMC database schema - Crook & Murray 2006)
2. **Social theme association:** What social history themes the object provides evidence for

### 4.2 Functional Categories (EAMC-based)

**Note:** Artefact specialist Penny Crook was unable to attend the archaeological team tagging session. **Verification needed** to ensure alignment with EAMC schema.

**Likely functional categories** (to be confirmed/expanded):

- Tableware (plates, cups, utensils)
- Storage containers (bottles, jars, tins)
- Cooking implements (pots, pans, hearth equipment)
- Tools (mining tools, carpentry tools, sewing implements)
- Structural materials (brick, nails, window glass, roofing)
- Personal items (clothing fasteners, jewellery, toys, smoking pipes)
- Industrial equipment (mining equipment, ropeway bucket)

### 4.3 Social Theme Associations

Following the same social history themes as historical documents, where evidence permits:

| Artefact Type | Functional Tag | Social Theme Tag(s) |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Gin bottles | bottles, storage | alcohol, alcoholism |
| Children's toys | toys | children, families |
| Cooking pots | cooking implements | food |
| Dress fasteners, jewellery | personal items | women, gender |
| Decorated ceramic tableware | tableware | families, domestic life, class (quality indicator) |
| Plain ceramic tableware | tableware | (basic domestic life) |
| Mining tools | tools | mining, labour, work |
| Tobacco pipes | smoking | leisure, consumption |

### 4.4 Ceramic Analysis and Class

**Following Lawrence (2000) at Dolly's Creek:**

- **Decorated ceramics** (transfer-printed, hand-painted) suggest investment in domestic comfort, family occupation, and aspirations toward "working-class respectability"
- **Plain ceramics** suggest more transient, basic living conditions
- **Tableware presence** vs cooking vessels only indicates level of domestic formality

## 5. Current Tagging Challenges and Rationalisation Needs

### 5.1 Analysis of Tag Patterns

**From 02_analyze_tags.py output (October 2025):**

- **332 similar tag pairs** detected (≥80% similarity)
- **137 potential hierarchical relationships** detected
- **40 singleton tags** (used only once)

### 5.2 Geographic Tag Proliferation

**Issue:** Mixing of geographic location + institution type + specific named institution creates redundancy.

#### Example: Katoomba tags

"Katoomba" (123 uses) has 21 detected child tags:

- Katoomba Hotel (5), Katoomba Rifle Reserves (5), Katoomba Congregational Church (12)
- Katoomba Court (8), Katoomba Progress Association (8), Katoomba School of Arts (13)
- Katoomba Council (22), Katoomba Falls (8), Katoomba Tennis Club (2)
- Katoomba Superior Public School (8), Katoomba Amateur Minstrels (2), Katoomba Public School (6)
- Katoomba Street (4), Katoomba band (7), Katoomba Coal and Shale Company (7)
- Katoomba coal mines (9), South Katoomba (10), Katoomba Shale Mine (4)
- Katoomba South mines (8), Katoomba station (5), Katoomba Family Hotel (2)
- Katoomba Amateur Dramatic Club (2), South Katoomba Reserve (1)

**Recommended approach:**

1. Keep "Katoomba" as **geographic tag**
2. Keep **institution type tags** (Court, Hotel, School, Church, Mine, etc.)
3. Keep **specific named institution tags** (Katoomba Court, Katoomba Hotel, etc.)
4. Apply **multiple tags**: Geographic + Institution type + Named institution
5. Example: Item about Katoomba Court → Tags: "Katoomba", "Court", "Katoomba Court"

**Benefits:**

- Enables searching by location alone ("all Katoomba items")
- Enables searching by institution type alone ("all court cases")
- Enables searching for specific named institution
- Supports hierarchical vocabulary mapping to Getty TGN and AAT

### 5.3 Court Tag Consolidation

**Current tags detected as similar:**

- Court (45 uses) - **Institution type (PARENT CATEGORY)**
- Court cases (45 uses) - **Sub-tag** for events/proceedings
- Supreme Court (4 uses) - **Sub-tag** for specific court level
- Katoomba Court (8 uses) - **Sub-tag** for specific courthouse building
- Police court (5 uses) - **Sub-tag** for specific proceeding type
- Courthouse (8 uses) - **Sub-tag** for building type
- Licensing Court (12 uses) - **Sub-tag** for specific proceeding type

**Recommended hierarchy (maintaining granularity):**

```text
Court (PARENT CATEGORY - institution type)
├── Court cases (sub-tag: events/proceedings about court)
├── Courthouse (sub-tag: building type)
├── Supreme Court (sub-tag: specific court level - hierarchical)
├── Police court (sub-tag: specific proceeding type)
├── Licensing Court (sub-tag: specific proceeding type)
└── Katoomba Court (sub-tag: specific courthouse building - also tagged "Katoomba")
```

**Cross-domain tagging example:**

An item about Katoomba Courthouse might receive:

- **Geographic:** "Katoomba"
- **Institution (parent):** "Court"
- **Institution (specific building):** "Court" → "Courthouse", "Court" → "Katoomba Court"
- **Structure type (archaeological):** "Structure" → "Government" → "Courthouse"

**Rationalisation principle:** **Err on the side of maintaining existing granularity.** It's easier to collapse tags later than to re-expand them. Temporary redundancy (e.g., "Court→Courthouse" + "Structure→Government→Courthouse") is acceptable during Phase 1.2; deduplication can occur in Phase 1.3 after historian feedback confirms utility.

### 5.4 People and Family Name Variations

**Challenge:** Many detected "similar" names are actually **different people**.

**Examples:**

**Wilson family:**

- Mr Wilson (5 uses)
- Mrs Wilson (2 uses)
- Mr W Wilson (2 uses)
- Mr Albert C Wilson (2 uses)
- Likely **3-4 different people**

**Meredith family:**

- Meredith family (36 uses) - Family tag
- Mr James Meredith (3 uses)
- Mr Thomas Meredith (2 uses)
- Mr Evan Thomas Meredith (4 uses)
- Mr Joseph Meredith (8 uses)
- Mr John Meredith (4 uses)
- Mr Stephen Meredith (7 uses)
- Mr Walter Meredith (5 uses)
- Mrs Meredith (2 uses)
- Mrs Joanna Meredith (3 uses)
- Mrs Eleanor Meredith (5 uses)
- Potentially **10+ different individuals**

**Recommended approach:**

1. **Preserve all individual person tags** - DO NOT merge similar names without verification
2. **Expand abbreviated names** using square brackets [  ] when identification is certain
   - Example: "Mr W. James" → "Mr W[illiam] James" (once confirmed via biographical research)
   - Example: "Mrs Smith" → "Mrs [Mary] Smith" (once identified)
3. **Retain family tags** as separate thematic tags (e.g., "Meredith family")
   - Family tags are explicit, not inferred from individual co-occurrence
4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER) principle:** Any proper noun that would be extracted during NER should eventually become a tag
   - All person names → individual person tags
   - All place names → geographic tags
   - Consider grouping under "Named Entities" category for future organisation
5. **Create person register** through:
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER) on primary source PDFs (full text analysis)
   - Cross-referencing with Australian Dictionary of Biography (ADB)
   - Genealogical research and family history sources
   - Biographical databases
   - This will be done collaboratively with Claude Code or via local LLM scripts

### 5.5 Singleton Tags Requiring Review

**40 tags used only once.** These may be:

- **Typos or spelling variations** → merge with standard form
- **Overly specific terms** → consolidate under broader category
- **Legitimate unique descriptors** → retain if evidenced

**Examples requiring review:**

- Mrs Rose Anna (Fanny) Lynch (nee Fisher) - **Legitimate person name**
- Choir - **Legitimate institution/activity** - merge with "Church" or "Music"?
- Bigamy - **Legitimate crime type** - keep as specific crime tag
- Rugby - **Legitimate sport** - keep or consolidate under "Sports"?
- Burragorang - **Legitimate place name** - keep
- Soldiers - **Legitimate occupation/social group** - keep
- Congregational Church - **Specific church denomination** - hierarchical under "Church"
- Public meeting - **Event type** - keep or consolidate?

---

## 6. Vocabulary Mapping and Interoperability

### 6.1 Getty Vocabularies Integration

**Goal:** Map rationalised tags to Getty vocabularies for interoperability and Linked Open Data (LOD).

**Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT):**

- Institution types: Court, Hotel, School, Church, Mine, etc.
- Building types: Hut, Dwelling, Hall, etc.
- Artefact types: Bottles, tableware, tools, etc.
- Activities: Mining, recreation, cooking, etc.
- Materials: Brick, glass, ceramic, iron, etc.

**Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN):**

- Katoomba (TGN ID to be identified)
- Lithgow (TGN ID to be identified)
- Blue Mountains region
- New South Wales
- Jamison Valley, Megalong Valley (may not have TGN entries - create local gazetteer)

### 6.2 Research Vocabularies Australia (RVA) Publication

**Planned deliverable (Phase 1.3):** Publish project-specific controlled vocabulary to RVA.

**Vocabulary components:**

1. **Blue Mountains mining heritage vocabulary** (based on rationalised tags)
2. **Local gazetteer** (places not in Getty TGN)
3. **Mining industry terminology** (specific to oil shale mining in NSW)
4. **Social history themes** (project-specific research categories)

**SKOS format:** Prepare vocabulary in Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) for RVA submission.

### 6.3 Australian Dictionary of Biography (ADB) Linking

**Goal:** Link person tags to ADB entries where available.

**Known ADB entries in dataset:**

- North, John Britty (1831-1917) - Edgar 1974, ADB Volume 5
- [Additional entries to be identified]

**Workflow:**

1. Extract all person names from tags
2. Search ADB online database
3. Record ADB persistent URLs for matched entries
4. Add ADB links as metadata in Zotero person records

---

## 7. Recommendations for Tag Rationalisation (Phase 1.2)

### 7.1 Priority Actions

**RATIONALISATION PRINCIPLE:** **Err on the side of maintaining existing granularity.** It's easier to collapse tags later than to re-expand them after information loss. Temporary redundancy is acceptable during Phase 1.2; await historian feedback on tag utility before aggressive consolidation.

**1. Metadata vs Subject Tags:**

- **Move "Primary source" to item type metadata field**
- Reserve tags for subject/thematic content only
- **Status:** The 304 "Primary source" tags represent 90.5% of tagged items - nearly all historical documents are primary sources

**2. Geographic Hierarchy:**

- Establish clear spatial hierarchy (Region > District/Valley > Settlement > Specific site)
- Apply **multiple co-occurring tags** (geographic + institution type + named institution)
  - Example: "Katoomba" + "Court" + "Katoomba Court"
- Distinguish mining districts (Ruined Castle, Nellie's Glen) from towns (Katoomba, Megalong)
- Create local gazetteer for places not in Getty TGN (Ruined Castle, Nellie's Glen)
- Link to Getty TGN where possible (Katoomba, Lithgow, Blue Mountains)
- Associate all features with coordinates/polygons for geospatial mapping

**3. Institution Type + Named Institution:**

- Maintain parent-child hierarchy: "Court" (parent) → "Katoomba Court" (child)
- Standardise institution type vocabulary as parent categories
- Apply **both parent and child tags** where applicable
- **Accept temporary cross-domain redundancy:**
  - Historical: "Court" → "Courthouse"
  - Archaeological: "Structure" → "Government" → "Courthouse"
  - Geographic: "Katoomba"
  - This preserves specialist perspectives; deduplicate in Phase 1.3 after feedback

**4. Court Tag Hierarchy (Decided):**

- **"Court" as PARENT CATEGORY** (institution type)
- Retain all sub-tags:
  - Court cases (events/proceedings)
  - Courthouse (building type)
  - Supreme Court (court level)
  - Police court, Licensing Court (proceeding types)
  - Katoomba Court (specific building + geographic tag "Katoomba")

**5. People and Families:**

- **DO NOT merge similar person names** without verification (many are different people)
- Expand abbreviated names using square brackets [ ] when certain
- Retain separate family tags (explicit, not inferred)
- **NER principle:** Any proper noun extractable via NER should become a tag
- Create person register through:
  - NER on primary source PDFs (full text analysis with Claude Code or local LLM)
  - Australian Dictionary of Biography (ADB) linking
  - Genealogical/biographical research

**6. Temporal Tags:**

- Format: Specific years ("1880", "1893") or year ranges ("1880-1885", "1890s")
- Apply consistently across items
- Key periods: 1880-1882 (North), 1885-1889 (peak), 1889 (crisis), 1889-1897 (AKO&M), 1893 (peak employment), 1897 (closure), 1903 (reopening), 1905 (abandonment)

**7. Singleton Tag Review:**

- Evaluate all 40 singleton tags with domain expert
- **Preserve legitimate unique descriptors** (person names, place names, specific events)
- Merge only confirmed typos/spelling variants
- Retain overly specific terms unless historian confirms consolidation
- Examples of legitimate singletons: "Bigamy" (crime type), "Burragorang" (place), "Rugby" (sport)

### 7.2 Consultation with Historians and Archaeologists

**Before finalising rationalisation:**

- **Review similar_tags.csv** (332 pairs) with project historians - confirm which are true duplicates vs distinct concepts
- **Review tag_hierarchy.csv** (137 relationships) - validate parent/child relationships
- **Review singleton tags** - determine which to retain, consolidate, or remove
- **Review institution type taxonomy** - ensure completeness for Blue Mountains context
- **Validate social history theme tags** - confirm alignment with research questions

### 7.3 Integration with Archaeological and Artefact Tags

**After historical document tags are rationalised:**

1. **Align archaeological feature tags** with rationalised historical vocabulary
2. **Verify artefact tags** with artefact specialist (Penny Crook) for EAMC schema compliance
3. **Enrich archaeological and artefact tags** with additional social theme associations
4. **Ensure cross-domain consistency** whilst respecting specialist needs

---

## 8. Future Work and Phase 1.2-1.4 Deliverables

### 8.1 Phase 1.2: Tag Schema Rationalisation

**Tasks:**

1. Consolidate similar/duplicate tags using similar_tags.csv recommendations
2. Standardise terminology and structure
3. Create hierarchical organisation using tag_hierarchy.csv
4. Document definitions and scope notes for all tags
5. Create controlled vocabulary documentation

**Dependencies:** Requires historian and archaeologist consultation (Phase 1.1 - this document)

### 8.2 Phase 1.3: Vocabulary Mapping & Publication

**Tasks:**

1. Map rationalised tags → Getty AAT and TGN
2. Create local gazetteer for places not in Getty TGN
3. Prepare SKOS-formatted vocabulary for Research Vocabularies Australia (RVA)
4. Publish controlled vocabulary to RVA
5. Document mappings for interoperability

**Resources:**

- docs/vocabularies.md - Getty AAT, TGN, and RVA standards
- docs/gazetteer-comparison.md - Geographic vocabulary options

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 1.2 completion

### 8.3 Phase 1.4: Batch Update Zotero

**Tasks:**

1. Apply rationalised tags to existing 336 tagged items via Zotero API
2. Preserve original tags as backup (separate Zotero collection or CSV export)
3. Validate updates
4. Begin tagging 853 untagged items using rationalised vocabulary

**Resources:**

- docs/api-integration.md - Zotero API patterns and best practices

**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 1.3 completion

### 8.4 Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Full Text Analysis

**Planned work:**

1. **Extract full text from primary source PDFs** (304 tagged items)
2. **Run Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to extract:
   - Person names (all individuals mentioned, not just protagonists)
   - Place names (all geographic references)
   - Organization names (companies, institutions, associations)
   - Dates and temporal expressions
3. **Create comprehensive registers:**
   - Person register with biographical links (ADB, genealogical databases)
   - Place name register with geospatial coordinates/gazetteer links (Getty TGN, local gazetteer)
   - Organization/institution register
4. **Validate and enrich existing tags:**
   - Compare NER results with current tags
   - Identify missing tags (entities not currently tagged)
   - Identify tag errors or inconsistencies
   - Expand abbreviated names using full text context
5. **Tag untagged items** (853 items) using NER + rationalised vocabulary

**Implementation approaches:**

**Option A: Interactive analysis with Claude Code (this tool):**

- Process PDFs collaboratively in this terminal session
- Human-in-the-loop verification of entity extraction
- Direct application of rationalised tag vocabulary
- Immediate feedback and correction

**Option B: Automated batch processing with local LLM:**

- Script-based processing using local large language model (up to 120B parameters)
- Prompt engineering with controlled vocabulary
- Batch processing for efficiency
- Post-processing verification workflow

**Option C: Hybrid approach (recommended):**

- Use Claude Code for first 10-20 PDFs (intensive validation, prompt refinement)
- Transition to local LLM for bulk processing (remaining 280+ PDFs)
- Spot-check 5-10% of LLM results for quality assurance
- Statistical validation across corpus

**Tools under consideration:**

- spaCy with custom historical NER model (19th-century Australian text)
- Stanford NER
- GPT-4 or Claude for zero-shot entity extraction
- Local LLMs (Llama, Mistral) with custom prompts
- Historical NER models trained on period-appropriate corpora
