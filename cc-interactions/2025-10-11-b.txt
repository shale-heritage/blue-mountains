  Recent Work Completed ✅

  Phase 1.1: Folksonomy Analysis - COMPLETE

  Key Deliverable: docs/folksonomy_logic.md (877 lines, ~9,200 words)

  This comprehensive documentation captures:

  1. Three Parallel Tagging Systems:
    - Historical documents (304 primary sources in Zotero, 90.5% of tagged items)
    - Archaeological features (~256 documented at Ruined Castle and Nellie's Glen)
    - Artefacts (~256 documented, EAMC schema-based)
  2. Research-Driven Tagging Framework:
    - Grounded in ARC LP190100900 research themes: social history, family history, labour history, deindustrialisation, environmental change
    - Documents why tags were chosen (social history theme evidence)
    - Explains inductively-developed approach by historians/archaeologists
  3. Hierarchical Structures Documented:
    - Geographic: Mining districts (Ruined Castle, Nellie's Glen) vs towns (Katoomba, Megalong)
    - Institutions: Parent categories (Court) → specific instances (Katoomba Court, Supreme Court)
    - Cross-domain redundancy explicitly accepted during rationalisation
  4. Rationalisation Principles:
    - "Err on the side of maintaining existing granularity" (easier to collapse than re-expand)
    - Multi-tag approach: Geographic + Institution type + Named institution
    - NER principle: Any proper noun extractable via NER should become a tag
    - People/families: Expand names with square brackets, retain family tags
  5. Future Work Roadmap:
    - Phase 1.2: Tag schema rationalisation
    - Phase 1.3: Vocabulary alignment (Getty AAT/TGN, RVA, ADB)
    - Phase 1.4: Named Entity Recognition + full text analysis (hybrid Claude Code + local LLM approach)

  ---
  What's Next 🎯

  Phase 1.2: Tag Schema Rationalisation

  Using the documented folksonomy logic and your domain expertise, we need to:

  1. Apply documented hierarchies to the 481 unique tags
    - Court tags (7 variants) → parent-child structure
    - Geographic tags (Katoomba has 21 children) → spatial hierarchy
    - Institution type + named institution separation
  2. Review the 332 similar tag pairs identified in data/similar_tags.csv
    - Maintain granularity where meaningful
    - Consolidate only typos/spelling variants
    - Document decisions for historian feedback
  3. Create preliminary controlled vocabulary for Phase 1.3 alignment work

  Would you like to start Phase 1.2 tag rationalisation now? We can work through the similar tags systematically using the folksonomy logic we've just documented.

> Ok, I think I need to give you the archaeological data. This data is recently tagged and lightly edited, but it is still messy and one of our tasks will be to clean and standardise it. You can, however, see the number of records (a handful are empty and will 
eventually need to be deleted). I have provided structured and geospatial data at this stage, we'll deal with photos later. The data was collected using FAIMS2.6, open-source digital field data collection system - I'll later give you access to the github repo where 
that software is, and the repo containing the customisation for this project, so we can add software informaiton to metadata (there is also a open-access publication about the software in SoftwareX, which I will provide in references/ later. It'a all in the 
archaeology/data/input/ folder, and I've prepare and I've provided an output/ folder for processed / cleaned data. Please look at the records and the tags. Artefacts are recorded alongside 'structure'-type features (or as 'artefact' / 'isolated find' features 
themselves) as an indicator of the nature of the feature. We'll likely leave the artefacts in groups like this rather than catalogue them individually. Once we get the tags rationalised and aligned as best we can with the historical tags, and get photos attached in 
a way that facilitates review, then we'll have the artefact specialist review them, but her time is limited and it must be utilised efficiently. Overall, the historical tags should drive the tagging of the archaeological evidence, without losing archaeologically 
valuable information that might be in existing tags - this is always a compromise and we're looking for a workable outcome without straining for unreachable perfection. Overall we want to be pragmatica about things and simply try to improve the value of *all* the 
datasets for researchers and the public. 

● I'll examine the archaeological data to understand its structure, volume, and current tagging approach.

     … +6 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Perfect! Now let me create a systematic plan for working with this archaeological data:

● Excellent! I can see the FAIMS2.6 data structure clearly now. Let me provide you with an analysis:

  Archaeological Data Overview

  Data Volume:
  - Ruined Castle (RC): 68 features (67 valid + 1 empty row)
  - Nellie's Glen (NG): 276 features (275 valid + 1 empty row)
  - Total: ~343 archaeological features
  - Additional data: 687 measurements, 2,382 feature-measurement relationships

  FAIMS Structure:
  The data has three key columns for our tagging work:
  1. Artefact Functional type - Functional categorisation (Food service, Bottle, Mechanical, Building material, etc.)
  2. Tags - Pipe-delimited tags (e.g., "Artefact | Work | Industrial")
  3. RevisedFeatureType - Revised classifications (Hearth, Platform, Artefact, Depression, etc.)

  Initial Tag Analysis

  From the sample, I can see the archaeological tagging follows the hierarchical structure you outlined in our folksonomy discussion:

  Structure/Feature Tags:
  - Hut → Hearth | Platform | Artefact
  - Dwelling → Hearth | Platform | Artefact
  - Work → Other (sawn trees, tree stumps)
  - Structure → Prop hole
  - Depression (pits, postholes)
  - Graffiti

  Artefact Functional Types:
  - Food service, Cooking, Food preparation
  - Bottle (alcohol, pharmaceutical)
  - Mechanical (ropeway elements, mining elements)
  - Building material
  - Implement (horseshoes)
  - Musical instrument
  - Chamber pot (waste)

  Social History Tags Applied to Archaeology:
  - Food, Alcohol, Pharmaceutical, Smoking
  - Horses, Industry
  - Clothing (buttons)
  - Music
  - Waste
  - Building-Material

  Key Observations

  1. Tag format: Pipe-delimited hierarchies (e.g., "Hearth | Platform | Artefact")
  2. Inconsistencies: Some typos visible ("Arefact", "Building-material" vs "Building-Material")
  3. Cross-references: "Xref" column shows feature associations (e.g., "1002 | 1003 | 1004")
  4. Empty records: A few features (4007, 4012, 4029) have minimal data
  5. Rich artefact detail: Material descriptions are very detailed in free text fields

  Would you like me to:
  1. Extract all unique tags from both RC and NG datasets?
  2. Compare archaeological tags with the 481 historical document tags?
  3. Identify alignment opportunities and gaps?
  4. Create standardised tag recommendations?

  This will help us understand the full scope before we begin rationalisation.

> ah, the pipe-delineated tags aren't hierarchical; let me explain: hut or dwelling are interpretations of the structure's use. Hearth and platform are the actual observed features (generally associated with huts/dwellings). Social history type tags are from the 
artefacts and their function / use / nature.  Actually, this misunderstanding means I need to document archaeological tags better - I have now provided our working hierarchy of structure tags; ceramics-related / derived tags follow the EAMC protocol you identified 
earlier. We should probably separate the two (structure vs artefact) tags in the output. See 'archaeological-tags.md' for the working hierarchy. Please update. 

● Thank you for the clarification! Let me read the archaeological tags documentation you've provided:

● Read(~/Code/blue-mountains/archaeological-tags.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Bash(find . -name "*archaeological*" -type f 2>/dev/null | head -20)
  ⎿  ./archaeology/data/input/archaeological-tags.md

● Read(archaeological-tags.md)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines

● Perfect! Now I understand the structure. Let me update my understanding and analysis:

● Now I understand! Let me extract and analyse the archaeological tags properly:

● Bash(cd archaeology/data/input && python3 << 'EOF'
      import csv…)
  ⎿  === STRUCTURE/INTERPRETATION TAGS (from 'Tags' column) ===
     Total unique tags: 40
     Total tag applications: 516
     … +108 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

● Excellent! Now I can see the actual structure. Let me create a comprehensive analysis script and then update the folksonomy documentation:

● Perfect! Now I understand the three-dimensional tagging system for archaeology. Let me summarise what I've learned:

  Corrected Understanding of Archaeological Tagging

  Three Separate Tag Dimensions in FAIMS Data:

  1. Tags column - Mixed structure interpretations + social history themes:
    - Structure interpretations: Hut (63), Dwelling (28), Structure (8), Pit (15), Posthole (2)
    - Work types: Work (63), Industrial (15), Industry (13), Transport (5), Mining (2)
    - Social history themes: Food (59), Alcohol (18), Pharmaceutical (8), Waste (10), Horses (4), Clothing (2), Women (2), Music (1), Smoking (1), Literacy (3)
    - Material types: Building-material variants (20 total)
    - Feature marker: Artefact (151) - indicates artefacts are present
  2. Artefact Functional type column - EAMC-based functional classification:
    - Bottle (60), Food service (41), Mechanical (31), Building material (23)
    - Cooking (5), Food storage (4), Chamber pot (6), Implement (9)
    - Writing (3), Apparel (2), Musical instrument (1)
  3. RevisedFeatureType column - Observed archaeological features:
    - Actual features observed: Platform (81), Hearth (78), Depression (23), Fence (16)
    - Mining/industrial features: Mining element (12), Ropeway element (9), Prop hole (4)
    - Other structures: Masonry (6), Trackway (5), Wall (1), Floor (1)
    - Marker: Artefact (153) - artefacts recorded with/at this feature

  Key Issues Identified:

  1. Inconsistent capitalisation/spelling:
    - "Building-material" (10) vs "Building material" (8) vs "Building-Material" (2) vs "Building materials" (1)
    - "Bottle" vs "Bootle" vs "Botttle" vs "bottle"
    - "Artefact" (151) vs "Arefact" (1)
    - "Depression" (23) vs "Depresson" (3) vs "Depressoin" (1)
    - "Food service" vs "Food Service" vs "food service"
  2. Mixing of categories in 'Tags' column:
    - Structure interpretations (Hut, Dwelling) + Social themes (Food, Alcohol) + Feature markers (Artefact, Work)
  3. Empty/minimal entries: One blank tag value (":")

  Now let me update the folksonomy documentation to correctly reflect this three-dimensional archaeological tagging system. Should I proceed with updating docs/folksonomy_logic.md?

> Go ahead and append to folksonomy_logic.md, but keep the archaeology tagging folksonomy in a separate secton, don't mis them up. In future, I will work with you to clean, correct, organise, and rationalise the archaeological tags, and alighn or map them against 
the historical tags. Ultimately, we want to be able to create collections, exhibitions, and walking tours on Omeka largely by examining tags. Note: in datasets naming, RC stands for 'Ruinded Castle'. NG stands for 'Nellies Glen'. Those are our two study areas.

        901 +  ### 11.2 Three-Dimensional Archaeological Tagging System
        902 +  
        903 +  Archaeological features in FAIMS receive **three separate types of tags**, recorded in distinct columns:
        904 +  
        905 +  #### 11.2.1 Column 1: `Tags` (Mixed Interpretations and Social Themes)
        906 +  
        907 +  **Purpose:** Records both **structural interpretations** and **social history theme associations**.
        908 +  
        909 +  **Structure interpretations** (what we think the feature was used for):
        910 +  
        911 +  - Hut (63 uses) - Small, simple dwelling interpretation
        912 +  - Dwelling (28 uses) - More substantial residence interpretation
        913 +  - Structure (8 uses) - General building interpretation
        914 +  - Work (63 uses) - Work-related feature
        915 +  - Pit (15 uses), Posthole (2 uses) - Cut feature interpretations
        916 +  
        917 +  **Work types and industrial features:**
        918 +  
        919 +  - Industrial (15 uses), Industry (13 uses), Mining (2 uses)
        920 +  - Transport (5 uses)
        921 +  
        922 +  **Social history theme tags** (applied where material evidence supports interpretation):
        923 +  
        924 +  - Food (59 uses) - Food-related artefacts
        925 +  - Alcohol (18 uses) - Alcohol bottles, gin cases

        933 +  - Literacy (3 uses) - Writing implements
        934 +  
        935 +  **Material/construction tags:**
        936 +

        938 +  - Artefact (151 uses) - Marker indicating artefacts are present at this feature
        939 +  
        940 +  **Special feature types:**
        941 +  
        942 +  - Drain (7 uses), Graffiti (1 use), Retaining wall (1 use), Trench (1 use)
        943 +  
        944 +  **Issues identified:**
        945 +  
        946 +  - Typos: "Arefact" (1 use) instead of "Artefact"
        947 +  - Inconsistent capitalisation across "Building-material" variants
        948 +  - One empty tag value (":")
        949 +  - Mixing of structural interpretations and social themes in same column
        950 +  
        951 +  #### 11.2.2 Column 2: `Artefact Functional type` (EAMC-based Classification)
        952 +  
        953 +  **Purpose:** Functional categorisation of artefacts following **EAMC database schema** (Crook & Murray 2006).
        954 +  
        955 +  **Most common functional types:**
        956 +

        963 +  - Cooking (5 uses) - Pots, pans, hearth equipment
        964 +  - Food storage (4 uses) - Storage containers, jars
        965 +  
        966 +  **Less common types:**
        967 +  
        968 +  - Tool (3 uses), Writing (3 uses), Apparel (2 uses), Barrel (2 uses)
        969 +  - Musical instrument (1 use), Food preparation (1 use), ACH (1 use - Aboriginal Cultural Heritage?)
        970 +  - Ore (1 use), Electrical component (1 use), Spoil (1 use)
        971 +  
        972 +  **Issues identified:**
        973 +  
        974 +  - Inconsistent capitalisation: "Bottle" vs "bottle", "Food service" vs "Food Service" vs "food service"
        975 +  - Typos: "Bootle" (2 uses), "Botttle" (1 use), "Buidling material" (1 use), "Chamber Pot" vs "Chamber pot"
        976 +  - "Building material" appears in both Tags column and Artefact Functional type column
        977 +  
        978 +  **Note:** Artefact specialist Penny Crook was unable to attend archaeological tagging session. **Verification needed** to ensure full alignment with EAMC schema.
        979 +  
        980 +  #### 11.2.3 Column 3: `RevisedFeatureType` (Observed Archaeological Features)
        981 +  
        982 +  **Purpose:** Records the **actual observable features** on the ground (not interpretations).
        983 +  
        984 +  **Most common feature types:**
        985 +  
        986 +  - Artefact (153 uses) - Isolated finds or artefact scatters
        987 +  - Platform (81 uses) - Levelled ground surface, typically foundation for structure
        988 +  - Hearth (78 uses) - Fireplace or cooking feature
        989 +  - Depression (23 uses) - Cut features, pits
        990 +  - Other (22 uses) - Sawn trees, tree stumps, fenceposts
        991 +  
        992 +  **Mining and industrial features:**
        993 +  
        994 +  - Mining element (12 uses) - Cart wheels, rail, mining equipment
        995 +  - Ropeway element (9 uses) - Bleichert ropeway buckets and infrastructure
        996 +  - Fence (16 uses), Trackway (5 uses)
        997 +  - Prop hole (4 uses) - Drilled holes for mine props
        998 +  - Masonry (6 uses), Wall (1 use), Floor (1 use)
        999 +  
       1000 +  **Special features:**
       1001 +  
       1002 +  - Double Hearth (2 uses) - Two hearths in same structure
       1003 +  - Graffiti (1 use), Oven (1 use), Fireplace (1 use)
       1004 +  - Bridge (1 use), Spoil (1 use), Quarry (1 use), Mound (1 use), Water race (1 use)
       1005 +  
       1006 +  **Issues identified:**
       1007 +  
       1008 +  - Typos: "Depresson" (3 uses), "Depressoin" (1 use) instead of "Depression"
       1009 +  - "Structure" appears in both Tags column (8 uses) and RevisedFeatureType column (2 uses)
       1010 +  - "Artefact" appears in both Tags column (151 uses) and RevisedFeatureType column (153 uses) - used as both a feature type marker and a category
       1011 +  
       1012 +  ### 11.3 Understanding Pipe-Delimited Tags
       1013 +  
       1014 +  **Format:** Tags are **pipe-delimited** (e.g., "Hut | Artefact | Food | Alcohol")
       1015 +  
       1016 +  **Important clarification:** The pipe delimiter does **not** indicate hierarchy. Multiple tags are simply listed together.
       1017 +  
       1018 +  **Example from Ruined Castle Feature 1006:**
       1019 +  
       1020 +  ```text
       1021 +  Tags: Hut
       1022 +  RevisedFeatureType: Hearth | Platform | Artefact
       1023 +  Artefact Functional type: Bottle
       1024 +  Material: Glass - Metal
       1025 +  Description: possible platform extends 2m southeast. metal bar (rail) across hearth.
       1026 +               olive green bottle glass.
       1027 +  ```
       1028 +  
       1029 +  **Interpretation:**
       1030 +  
       1031 +  - **Structural interpretation:** This feature is interpreted as a **Hut** (dwelling)
       1032 +  - **Observed features:** A **Hearth** with an associated **Platform** and **Artefacts**
       1033 +  - **Artefact type:** Glass **Bottle** (alcohol)
       1034 +  - **Social theme inference:** Presence of alcohol bottles at domestic feature
       1035 +  
       1036 +  **Not hierarchical:** "Hearth | Platform | Artefact" means three separate observed features, not "Hearth contains Platform which contains Artefact"
       1037 +  
       1038 +  ### 11.4 Separation of Structure vs Artefact Tags
       1039 +  
       1040 +  **Future data processing requirement:** Archaeological tags need to be **separated into two distinct categories** for analysis:
       1041 +  
       1042 +  #### Structure/Feature Tags
       1043 +  
       1044 +  **Source columns:** `Tags` (interpretation), `RevisedFeatureType` (observation)
       1045 +  
       1046 +  **Examples:**
       1047 +  
       1048 +  - Hut, Dwelling, Structure (interpretations of building function)
       1049 +  - Platform, Hearth, Depression (observed archaeological features)
       1050 +  - Mining element, Ropeway element, Prop hole (industrial features)
       1051 +  - Fence, Trackway, Wall (construction features)
       1052 +  
       1053 +  **Workflow:**
       1054 +  
       1055 +  1. Extract structure-related tags from both `Tags` and `RevisedFeatureType` columns
       1056 +  2. Standardise terminology (fix typos, capitalisation inconsistencies)
       1057 +  3. Map to hierarchical structure vocabulary (from `archaeological-tags.md`)
       1058 +  4. Align with historical document tags for institutions and buildings
       1059 +  
       1060 +  #### Artefact Tags
       1061 +  
       1062 +  **Source columns:** `Artefact Functional type` (EAMC schema), `Tags` (social themes)
       1063 +  
       1064 +  **Examples:**
       1065 +  
       1066 +  - **Functional:** Bottle, Food service, Mechanical, Building material, Cooking, Implement
       1067 +  - **Social themes:** Food, Alcohol, Pharmaceutical, Clothing, Horses, Women, Music, Smoking
       1068 +  
       1069 +  **Workflow:**
       1070 +  
       1071 +  1. Extract artefact functional types from `Artefact Functional type` column
       1072 +  2. Extract social history theme tags associated with artefacts from `Tags` column
       1073 +  3. Verify functional categories against EAMC schema with artefact specialist
       1074 +  4. Align social theme tags with rationalised historical document tags
       1075 +  
       1076 +  ### 11.5 Archaeological Tag Statistics Summary
       1077 +  
       1078 +  **Tags column (combined structure + social themes):**
       1079 +  
       1080 +  - 40 unique tags
       1081 +  - 516 total tag applications
       1082 +  - Most common: Artefact (151), Work (63), Hut (63), Food (59), Dwelling (28), Alcohol (18)
       1083 +  
       1084 +  **Artefact Functional type column:**
       1085 +  
       1086 +  - 29 unique functional types
       1087 +  - 211 total applications
       1088 +  - Most common: Bottle (60), Food service (41), Mechanical (31), Building material (23)
       1089 +  
       1090 +  **RevisedFeatureType column:**
       1091 +  
       1092 +  - 25 unique feature types
       1093 +  - 427 total applications
       1094 +  - Most common: Artefact (153), Platform (81), Hearth (78), Depression (23), Other (22)
       1095 +  
       1096 +  ### 11.6 Issues Requiring Rationalisation
       1097 +  
       1098 +  **Spelling and capitalisation inconsistencies:**
       1099 +  
       1100 +  1. **Building material variants:**
       1101 +     - "Building-material" (10), "Building material" (8), "Building-Material" (2), "Building materials" (1)
       1102 +     - **Recommendation:** Standardise to "Building material"
       1103 +  
       1104 +  2. **Bottle variants:**
       1105 +     - "Bottle" (60), "Bootle" (2), "Botttle" (1), "bottle" (1)
       1106 +     - **Recommendation:** Standardise to "Bottle"
       1107 +  
       1108 +  3. **Depression variants:**
       1109 +     - "Depression" (23), "Depresson" (3), "Depressoin" (1)
       1110 +     - **Recommendation:** Standardise to "Depression"
       1111 +  
       1112 +  4. **Food service variants:**
       1113 +     - "Food service" (41), "Food Service" (3), "food service" (1)
       1114 +     - **Recommendation:** Standardise to "Food service"
       1115 +  
       1116 +  5. **Artefact variants:**
       1117 +     - "Artefact" (151), "Arefact" (1)
       1118 +     - **Recommendation:** Fix typo
       1119 +  
       1120 +  6. **Other minor typos:**
       1121 +     - "Buidling material" → "Building material"
       1122 +     - "Chamber Pot" vs "Chamber pot" → Standardise
       1123 +  
       1124 +  **Redundancy between columns:**
       1125 +  
       1126 +  - "Artefact" appears in both Tags (151) and RevisedFeatureType (153)
       1127 +  - "Structure" appears in both Tags (8) and RevisedFeatureType (2)
       1128 +  - "Building material" appears in both Tags (20 total) and Artefact Functional type (23)
       1129 +  
       1130 +  **Recommendation:** Clarify functional roles of each column during Phase 1.2 rationalisation.
       1131 +  
       1132 +  **Empty/minimal records:**
       1133 +  
       1134 +  - One empty tag value (":")
       1135 +  - Several features with minimal data (e.g., RC Feature 4007, NG Feature 4012)
       1136 +  - **Recommendation:** Review for deletion or completion
       1137 +  
       1138 +  ### 11.7 Future Work: Archaeological Tag Alignment
       1139 +  
       1140 +  **Phase 1.2+: After Historical Document Tag Rationalisation**
       1141 +  
       1142 +  1. **Clean and standardise archaeological tags:**
       1143 +     - Fix all spelling and capitalisation inconsistencies
       1144 +     - Remove empty/minimal records
       1145 +     - Separate structure tags from artefact tags in output datasets
       1146 +  
       1147 +  2. **Map archaeological structure tags to historical institution/building tags:**
       1148 +     - Align "Hut" / "Dwelling" with "Accommodation" / "Housing" tags from historical documents
       1149 +     - Map "Court" (historical) to "Courthouse" (archaeological Structure type)
       1150 +     - Ensure consistency for institutions appearing in both datasets
       1151 +  
       1152 +  3. **Align archaeological social theme tags with rationalised historical tags:**
       1153 +     - Food, Alcohol, Pharmaceutical, Waste, Horses, Clothing, Women, Music, Smoking, Literacy
       1154 +     - Apply same terminology across all three tagging systems
       1155 +  
       1156 +  4. **Verify artefact functional categories with specialist:**
       1157 +     - Review EAMC schema alignment with Penny Crook
       1158 +     - Confirm functional categories are correct
       1159 +     - Enrich artefact tags where needed
       1160 +  
       1161 +  5. **Enable Omeka integration:**
       1162 +     - Collections grouped by social history themes (Food, Alcohol, Family, etc.)
       1163 +     - Exhibitions combining historical documents + archaeological features + artefacts
       1164 +     - Walking tours linking geographic tags + archaeological features + historical events
       1165 +  
       1166 +  **Ultimate goal:** Seamless integration of historical, archaeological, and artefact evidence through shared, rationalised tagging vocabulary.
       1167 +

       1169 +  
       1170 +  ## 12. Omeka Integration and Public Engagement Goals
       1171 +  
       1172 +  ### 12.1 Purpose of Tag Rationalisation
       1173 +  
       1174 +  The ultimate purpose of tag rationalisation is to enable **Omeka-based public engagement** with the Blue Mountains shale mining heritage collection.
       1175 +  
       1176 +  **Target audiences:**
       1177 +  
       1178 +  - Academic researchers (history, archaeology, heritage)
       1179 +  - Heritage managers and conservation professionals
       1180 +  - Local historians and community history groups
       1181 +  - Family historians researching Blue Mountains connections
       1182 +  - General public interested in mining heritage and local history
       1183 +  - School groups and educational programmes
       1184 +  
       1185 +  ### 12.2 Omeka Collections (Thematic Grouping)
       1186 +  
       1187 +  **Collections organised by social history themes:**
       1188 +  
       1189 +  Tags enable automatic/semi-automatic generation of thematic collections:
       1190 +  
       1191 +  - **Working Life Collection:** Mining, Miners, Labour, Industry, Wages, Employment
       1192 +  - **Family Life Collection:** Families, Women, Children, Marriage, Birth, Death
       1193 +  - **Community Life Collection:** Church, School, Recreation, Sports, Entertainment, Associations
       1194 +  - **Conditions of Living Collection:** Housing, Food, Drink, Alcohol, Health, Sanitary conditions
       1195 +  - **Law and Order Collection:** Court, Crime, Police, Violence, Accidents
       1196 +  - **Mining Heritage Collection:** Shale mines, Companies, Mining accidents, Ropeways, Industrial archaeology
       1197 +  
       1198 +  **Cross-collection items:** Many items will appear in multiple collections (e.g., a court case about mining accident appears in Law and Order + Working Life + specific company collection).
       1199 +  
       1200 +  ### 12.3 Omeka Exhibitions (Narrative Storytelling)
       1201 +  
       1202 +  **Exhibitions combine historical documents, archaeological features, and artefacts** to tell specific stories:
       1203 +  
       1204 +  **Example exhibition 1: "Life in a Mining Hut"**
       1205 +  
       1206 +  - Historical documents: Court cases about hut conditions, newspaper articles about housing
       1207 +  - Archaeological features: Hut platforms, hearths, associated artefacts
       1208 +  - Artefacts: Cooking implements, alcohol bottles, food service items, structural materials
       1209 +  - Narrative: Daily life, living conditions, material culture, class and aspiration
       1210 +  
       1211 +  **Example exhibition 2: "The Bleichert Ropeway"**
       1212 +  
       1213 +  - Historical documents: Company records, newspaper articles about ropeway construction/operation
       1214 +  - Archaeological features: Ropeway element locations (mapped)
       1215 +  - Artefacts: Ropeway buckets, mechanical components, photographs
       1216 +  - Narrative: Industrial technology, engineering achievement, economic boom/bust
       1217 +  
       1218 +  **Example exhibition 3: "Women and Children in Mining Communities"**
       1219 +  
       1220 +  - Historical documents: Court cases, birth/death records, school records
       1221 +  - Archaeological features: Dwelling platforms with children's toys, gender-specific artefacts
       1222 +  - Artefacts: Children's toys, women's clothing fasteners, domestic items, decorated tableware
       1223 +  - Narrative: Family history, gender roles, childhood in isolated settlements
       1224 +  
       1225 +  ### 12.4 Walking Tours (Geospatial Integration)
       1226 +  
       1227 +  **Walking tours link geographic locations with historical and archaeological evidence:**
       1228 +  
       1229 +  **Example walking tour: "Ruined Castle Mining Settlement"**
       1230 +  
       1231 +  Using GPS coordinates from archaeological features + georeferenced historical documents:
       1232 +  
       1233 +  1. **Stop 1: Ropeway Loading Point**
       1234 +     - Archaeological: Ropeway element locations, platform remains
       1235 +     - Historical: Company records, newspaper articles about ropeway operations
       1236 +     - Theme: Industrial technology and economic boom
       1237 +  
       1238 +  2. **Stop 2: Miners' Huts**
       1239 +     - Archaeological: Hut platforms, hearths, artefact scatters
       1240 +     - Historical: Court cases about living conditions, wages, accidents
       1241 +     - Artefacts: Domestic items, food/alcohol evidence, children's toys
       1242 +     - Theme: Daily life, family and community
       1243 +  
       1244 +  3. **Stop 3: Mine Entrance (Addit)**
       1245 +     - Archaeological: Addit location, spoil heaps, mine infrastructure
       1246 +     - Historical: Mining accident reports, employment records
       1247 +     - Theme: Working conditions, danger, labour history
       1248 +  
       1249 +  4. **Stop 4: Managers' Residence**
       1250 +     - Archaeological: High-quality masonry structure
       1251 +     - Historical: Company hierarchy, class divisions
       1252 +     - Theme: Social stratification in mining communities
       1253 +  
       1254 +  **Mobile-friendly format:** Walking tours delivered via Omeka mobile site or app, using device GPS for location-based content delivery.
       1255 +  
       1256 +  ### 12.5 Tag Requirements for Omeka Integration
       1257 +  
       1258 +  To enable collections, exhibitions, and walking tours, tags must:
       1259 +  
       1260 +  1. **Be consistent** across historical documents, archaeological features, and artefacts
       1261 +  2. **Support thematic grouping** (social history themes as primary organising principle)
       1262 +  3. **Enable geographic filtering** (place names, coordinates, spatial relationships)
       1263 +  4. **Link related items** across different evidence types (documents about Hut X + archaeological remains of Hut X + artefacts from Hut X)
       1264 +  5. **Support temporal filtering** (date ranges, significant periods)
       1265 +  6. **Connect to external resources** (Getty vocabularies, ADB entries, gazetteers)
       1266 +  
       1267 +  **This is why tag rationalisation is critical:** Without consistent, well-structured tags, automated/semi-automated creation of Omeka content is impossible.

  - Pipe delimiters do NOT indicate hierarchy
  - "Hearth | Platform | Artefact" means three co-occurring features, not nested hierarchy
  - Structure tags and artefact tags must be separated in future processing

  Issues identified for Phase 1.2+ work:
  - Spelling inconsistencies: "Artefact"/"Arefact", "Depression"/"Depresson"
  - Capitalisation variants: "Building-material" (4 variants), "Bottle"/"bottle"
  - Redundancy across columns
  - Empty/minimal records needing review

  Omeka Integration Planning (Section 12)

  Documented the ultimate goal of tag rationalisation work:

  Omeka Collections - Thematic grouping by social history themes:
  - Working Life, Family Life, Community Life, Conditions of Living, Law and Order, Mining Heritage

  Omeka Exhibitions - Narrative storytelling:
  - Example: "Life in a Mining Hut" combining documents + archaeological features + artefacts

  Walking Tours - Geospatial integration:
  - Example: "Ruined Castle Mining Settlement" with 4 GPS-located stops

  Tag requirements: Consistency, thematic grouping, geographic filtering, cross-evidence linking, temporal filtering, external resource connections

  What's Next?

  Phase 1.2: Tag Schema Rationalisation

  With Phase 1.1 complete, you can now begin Phase 1.2 work:

  1. Historical document tags first (481 unique tags from Zotero)
    - Review 332 similar tag pairs in data/similar_tags.csv
    - Establish hierarchies using data/tag_hierarchy.csv
    - Apply documented rationalisation principles (maintain granularity)
  2. Archaeological tags second (after historical tags rationalised)
    - Clean spelling/capitalisation inconsistencies
    - Separate structure tags from artefact tags
    - Align with rationalised historical vocabulary
  3. Create controlled vocabulary for Phase 1.3 Getty mapping and RVA publication

  Would you like to begin Phase 1.2 tag rationalisation now, working through the similar tags systematically using the folksonomy logic we've documented?

> This is an excellent summary, thank you. Please generate a compact message and we'll compact before we begin tag schema rationalisation, beginning wit th ehistorical document tags first.
